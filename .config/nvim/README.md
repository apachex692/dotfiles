# Neovim Configuration (_zero plugins_)

This is my Neovim configuration. I'm a minimalist, and hence I've written all the configurations _from scratch without any plugins._ It has the following features:

1. Full LSP Support for:
   1. Python (with Ruff and Pyright)
   2. Go (coming soon)
2. Easy Keyboard Bindings
3. Netrw and FZF Support (with FZF caching)
